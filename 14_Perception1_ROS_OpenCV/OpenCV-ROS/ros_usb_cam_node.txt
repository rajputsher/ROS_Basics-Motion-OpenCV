1. To run the usb_cam node 
	rosrun usb_cam usb_cam_node _pixel_format:=yuyv
	
2. Make sure the node is running by seeing the topics :
	rostopic list
output: 
	/rosout
	/rosout_agg
	/usb_cam/camera_info
Topic to see the live feed:
	/usb_cam/image_raw
	/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed
	/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_descriptions
	/usb_cam/image_raw/compressed/parameter_updates
	/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth
	/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_descriptions
	/usb_cam/image_raw/compressedDepth/parameter_updates
	/usb_cam/image_raw/theora
	/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_descriptions
	/usb_cam/image_raw/theora/parameter_updates

3. Run this topic with the following command:
	rosrun image_view  image_view image:=/usb_cam/image_raw

4. Now run the image_pub_sub.py to see the pattern drawn on the image after transforming the ROS image format to OpenCV image.
i.e. convert ros_image into an opencv-compatible image
